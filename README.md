# Hall-Booking-API

This is my Hall Booking API which was designed by me using NodeJs and ExpressJS. It's Guvi-Zen class Roadmap session: Day-38 and Nodejs- Day -2 Task.

## Tech Stack

- NodeJs
- ExpressJS
- Router()
- json()
- cors
- Nodemon
- date-fns
- postman

## Features

- Through this you can create room, book room, view all room info and see the particular person booked details with the help of specified api endpoints.

## Lessons Learned

Through this task I learned to create express server, API endpoints and usage of cors and json(). And also, I learned to use postman-API Testing Tool and api documentation.

## Testing Tool

I used Postman to test my api endpoints are working fine.
